```{r}
library(dplyr)
df <- mtcars

# Return rows of cars that have an mpg value greater than 20 and 6 cylinders.

head(filter(df, mpg>20 & cyl==6))


# Reorder the Data Frame by cyl first, then by descending wt.

arrange(df, cyl, desc(wt))


# Select the columns mpg and hp

select(df, mpg,hp)


# Select the distinct values of the gear column.

distinct(select(df, gear))


# Create a new column called "Performance" which is calculated by hp divided by wt.

mutate(df, performance=hp/wt)


# Find the mean mpg value using dplyr.

summarise(df,mean(mpg))


# Use pipe operators to get the mean hp value for cars with 6 cylinders.

df %>% filter(cyl==6) %>% summarise(mean(hp))
