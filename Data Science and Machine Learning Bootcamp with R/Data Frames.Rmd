R Data Frames Exercises
```{r}
# Ex 1: Recreate the following dataframe by creating vectors and using the data.frame function:

Age <- c(22,25,26)
Weight <- c(150,165,120)
Sex <- c("M","M","F")

df <- data.frame(Age, Weight, Sex)
row.names(df) <- c("Sam","Frank","Amy")


# Ex 2: Check if mtcars is a dataframe using is.data.frame()

is.data.frame(mtcars)


# Ex 3: Use as.data.frame() to convert a matrix into a dataframe:
  
mat <- matrix(1:25, nrow=5)
mat <- as.data.frame(mat)  
  
# Ex 4: Set the built-in data frame mtcars as a variable df. We'll use this df variable for the rest of the exercises.

df <- mtcars


# Ex 5: Display the first 6 rows of df

head(df)


# Ex 6: What is the average mpg value for all the cars?

mean(df$mpg) #20.09062


# Ex 7: Select the rows where all cars have 6 cylinders (cyl column)

subset(df, cyl==6)


# Ex 8: Select the columns am,gear, and carb.

df[,c("am","gear","carb")]


# Ex 9: Create a new column called performance, which is calculated by hp/wt.

df$performance <- df$hp/df$wt


# Ex 10: Your performance column will have several decimal place precision. Figure out how to use round() (check help(round)) to reduce this accuracy to only 2 decimal places.

df$performance <- round(df$performance,2)


# Ex 11: What is the average mpg for cars that have more than 100 hp AND a wt value of more than 2.5.

q <- subset(df,hp>100 & wt>2.5)
mean(q$mpg) #16.86364


# Ex 11: What is the mpg of the Hornet Sportabout?
df["Hornet Sportabout","mpg"] #18.7

```
